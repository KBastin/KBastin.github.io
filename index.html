        <h1>👋 Hello, I'm Kevin</h1>
        <p>I'm a full-stack developer based in Belgium, specializing in .NET and C#. I love bringing complex ideas to
            life through clean, reliable code.</p>
        <p>While my main expertise lies in the .NET ecosystem, I’m always open to exploring other technologies and
            adapting to the needs of the team or the product. I'm driven by learning, building, and delivering.</p>

        <h1>💼 What I'm Looking For</h1>
        <p>I'm actively seeking a full-time developer role (remote or hybrid). My goal is to join a team where I can

        <h1>✅ How I Like to Work</h1>
        <p>I thrive in teams that follow Agile methodologies, especially Scrum with regular sprints, planning, and
            retrospectives. I strongly value:
        <ul>
            <li>A clean Git workflow with branches, pull requests, and meaningful commit history</li>
            <li>Clear, well-defined tickets with proper Definition of Ready and Definition of Done</li>
            <li>Open communication, structured collaboration, and mutual respect between team members</li>
            <li>A balance between delivering features and maintaining code quality over time</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I'm convinced that good process creates good products. Having shared standards, clear goals, and
            accountability helps everyone move faster — and with fewer bugs.</p>
